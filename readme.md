Android GNSS
===

This is the python implementation of the Matlab based[GPS Measurement Tools from the Goggle](https://github.com/google/gps-measurement-tools) designed as a part of [Where Camp Berlin](http://wherecamp.de/).
The aim of this repo is to:

* explain the mechanism of calculating GNSS observations in Android N
* create python equivalent of [GPS Measurement Tools from the Goggle](https://github.com/google/gps-measurement-tools)


## files

* **ProcessRanges.ipynb** - explains how to calculate pseudoranges from Android N data, roughly equivalent of `ProcessGnssMeas.m`
